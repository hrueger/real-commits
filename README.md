# Real Commits Badge
A badge generator to show the "real" commits of a repository.

It lists all commits, but ignores those ones made by a bot.

## How to use
Clone this repo, run `npm i`, create a file called `token.secret` and put a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in the file. Then run `node index.js` and there you go!
